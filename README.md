An immersive AR/VR-based street racing experience developed using Unity.
This project focuses on creating an interactive and visually engaging racing environment using extended reality (XR) technologies.

📌 Project Overview

KaranKumbhar Street Racing AR/VR is an experimental AR/VR application that simulates a street racing environment where users can explore and interact with 3D racing scenes. The project demonstrates the use of XR Interaction Toolkit, real-time 3D rendering, and Unity’s AR/VR development workflow.

This project was developed as a technical/portfolio project to gain hands-on experience in immersive technologies.
