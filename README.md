KaranKumbhar Street Racing AR/VR

KaranKumbhar Street Racing AR/VR is a Unity-based AR/VR project focused on building an interactive street racing environment. The main purpose of this project is to explore immersive technologies and understand how extended reality can be used to create engaging 3D experiences.

This project was developed as a portfolio project to gain practical experience in AR/VR development, Unity workflows, and XR technologies.

About the Project

In this project, I worked on designing a virtual street racing setup where users can explore a racing scene and interact with objects inside the environment. The application is built using Unity and XR tools to handle user interaction, rendering, and scene management.

Through this project, I learned how to structure an AR/VR application, work with 3D assets, and develop interactive environments suitable for extended reality platforms.
