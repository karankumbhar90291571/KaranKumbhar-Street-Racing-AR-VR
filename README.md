🏎️ KaranKumbhar Street Racing AR/VR

KaranKumbhar Street Racing AR/VR is a Unity-based AR/VR project that focuses on building an interactive street-racing environment. The goal of this project is to explore how immersive technologies can be used to create engaging 3D racing experiences.

This project was created as a portfolio project to gain practical experience in AR/VR development, Unity workflows, and XR technologies.

📌 About the Project

In this project, I worked on designing a virtual street-racing setup where users can explore a racing scene and interact with objects inside the environment. The project uses Unity’s XR tools to handle interactions and rendering.

Through this project, I learned how to structure an AR/VR application, manage 3D assets, and build interactive scenes suitable for extended reality platforms.
